Dear Mr. Connell,

I appreciated you taking the time to chat with me today about ABC News Company, and the ever-changing media world. As I approach my graduation date from XYZ Journalism School, I'm full of questions about the roles available in media. Your insights gained from your career in the industry, as well as your perspective on ABC News Company's five-year plan, were incredibly helpful. Matthew Whitaker's insights were also incredibly helpful, please send my thanks.

I was particularly struck by your ideas on long-form journalism, along with the help (and problems) that social media can provide investigative journalists. You've given me much to think about as I embark on my job search. And, I'm so appreciative for your actionable advice about my writing portfolio â€” it was so kind of you to really dig in and share your ideas for how to structure it.

I look forward to staying in touch (I'll let Maura Caslin know that we connected), and will let you know how my job search progresses. I hope you'll keep me in mind if any roles open up at ABC New Company, too. Thank you again for taking the time to meet today, and for your thoughtful notes on my portfolio.

Sincerely,
Sarah Armand
